## Java Course - GeeksforGeeks

This folder contains all the Java programs and practice codes I wrote while following the Java course on [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/batch/java-foundation-2?tab=Chapters).  
Each file corresponds to a different concept or problem, such as OOPs, data structures, exception handling, recursion, and more.

âœ… All codes are written, tested, and organized topic-wise for easy reference.
